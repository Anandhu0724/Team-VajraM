### CHRONO-SHIFT Repository

**An app for Calculating the Cosmos: Time Dilation & Habitable Worlds**

This repository contains the source code for CHRONO-SHIFT, an interactive web application developed by Team Vajram. 
As humanity moves closer to interstellar exploration , this app is designed to answer two key questions:
"How does time behave differently in space?" and "How can we find new habitable planets for the future of life?".

Our mission is to make complex astrophysical concepts, like Einstein's theory of Time Dilation, accessible and understandable to everyone . The application provides interactive tools, data-driven visualizations, and learning modules to explore the effects of velocity and gravity on time and to systematically chart humanity's next potential home.

#### **Core Features**

* **Time Dilation Engine**: An interactive module demonstrating how time is a calculated variable in space travel.
* **Space Surf**: A real-time satellite view of the solar system and beyond, providing visuals and in-depth knowledge about celestial bodies.
* **Celestialpedia**: A knowledge hub with essential data on space objects like black holes, neutron stars, and galaxies, which serve as major examples of time dilation.
* **Learning Modules**: Comprehensive lessons covering the fundamental theorems and concepts behind time relations.
* **Challenges**: Engaging quizzes to test and reinforce user knowledge of time dilation and space concepts.

#### **Technical Architecture**

* **Architecture**: Client-Server model that uses real-time data from space APIs mainly nasa API.
***Tech Stack**: React / Node.js / WebGL.
***3D Visualization**: Implemented with WebGL for dynamic space object rendering.
* **APIs**: Fetches real-time satellite data from nasa and cosmic details beyond our solar system.
***Deployment**: Continuous deployment via GitHub to Netlify.
***Security**: Employs HTTPS, JWT authentication, and encrypted data exchange.
