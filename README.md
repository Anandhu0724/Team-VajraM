### CHRONO-SHIFT Repository

[cite_start]**An app for Calculating the Cosmos: Time Dilation & Habitable Worlds** [cite: 2]

[cite_start]This repository contains the source code for CHRONO-SHIFT, an interactive web application developed by Team Vajram[cite: 3]. [cite_start]As humanity moves closer to interstellar exploration [cite: 9][cite_start], this app is designed to answer two key questions: "How does time behave differently in space?" [cite: 12] [cite_start]and "How can we find new habitable planets for the future of life?"[cite: 13].

[cite_start]Our mission is to make complex astrophysical concepts, like Einstein's theory of Time Dilation, accessible and understandable to everyone[cite: 18, 19, 21]. [cite_start]The application provides interactive tools, data-driven visualizations, and learning modules to explore the effects of velocity and gravity on time and to systematically chart humanity's next potential home[cite: 14, 58].

#### **Core Features**

* [cite_start]**Time Dilation Engine**: An interactive module demonstrating how time is a calculated variable in space travel[cite: 14, 57].
* [cite_start]**Space Surf**: A real-time satellite view of the solar system and beyond, providing visuals and in-depth knowledge about celestial bodies[cite: 35, 39].
* [cite_start]**Celestialpedia**: A knowledge hub with essential data on space objects like black holes, neutron stars, and galaxies, which serve as major examples of time dilation[cite: 34, 38].
* [cite_start]**Learning Modules**: Comprehensive lessons covering the fundamental theorems and concepts behind time relations[cite: 36, 40].
* [cite_start]**Challenges**: Engaging quizzes to test and reinforce user knowledge of time dilation and space concepts[cite: 37, 41].
